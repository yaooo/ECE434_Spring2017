Type "make" for more instructions for part 3 of this problem.

We can build in two ways (each of these will build mtsort.c):
	make ult - Build mtsort with your ULT implementation.
	make system - Build the mtsort using the system pthreads implementation.


To run the test file after making the file:
	
	If you choose to build using ULT, please run the following code:
		./mtsort-ult

	If you choose to build using system, please run the following code:
		./mtsort-system
